Setup\n\nBefore you use the example code in this notebook, follow these setup steps:\n\n1. Log in to  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/\">IBM Bluemix</a> and go to the space in your Bluemix account that you created in [Notebook 1: Creating a Kafka producer of clickstream events](https://github.com/wdp-beta/get-started/blob/master/notebooks/localcart-scenario-part-1.ipynb).\n1. Ensure that you have created the following components:\n    * The source of data piped into MessageHub topics that you set up in the first notebook in the series, [Notebook 1: Creating a Kafka producer of clickstream events](https://github.com/wdp-beta/get-started/blob/master/notebooks/localcart-scenario-part-1.ipynb).\n    * The Streaming Pipelines service that you created in the second notebook of the series[Notebook 2: Creating a streaming pipeline](https://github.com/wdp-beta/get-started/blob/master/notebooks/localcart-scenario-part-2.ipynb). The Streaming Pipelines service subscribes to the MessageHub topics and aggregates the data into the Compose for Redis database.\n    * A Compose for Redis database that you set up in the second notebook of the series to store the aggregated data prior to it being rendered. [Notebook 2: Creating a streaming pipeline](https://github.com/wdp-beta/get-started/blob/master/notebooks/localcart-scenario-part-2.ipynb) \n    \n    If you did not run notebook 2 of the series, you must create a [Compose for Redis](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-redis) database. To connect to the Compose for Redis database, you need the following information:\n        * Redis password\n        * Host name \n        * Host port\n             \n1.
