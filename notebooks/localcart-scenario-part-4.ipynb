(ADD LINK TO NOTEBOOK 1)\n1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads\">Download CloudFoundry CLI</a> on your local machine. \n1.

(ADD LINK TO NOTEBOOK 1)\n    * The Streaming Pipelines service that you created in the second notebook of the series(ADD LINK TO NOTEBOOK 2). The Streaming Pipelines service subscribes to the MessageHub topics and aggregates the data into the Compose for Redis database.\n    * A Compose for Redis database that you set up in the second notebook of the series to store the aggregated data prior to it being rendered. (ADD LINK TO NOTEBOOK 2) \n    \n    If you did not run notebook 2 of the series, you must create a Compose for Redis database. You can use the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-redis\">Compose for Redis</a> or the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/redis-cloud\">Redis Cloud</a> services in IBM Bluemix.
